    - "We Thought We Were Searching Google, But Google Was Searching Us"
    - "At its core, surveillance capitalism is parasitic and self-referential. It revives Karl Marx's old image of capitalism as a vampire that feeds on labor, but with an unexpected turn... Instead of labor, surveillance capitalism feeds on every aspect of human's experience."

> Corporations have created a new kind of marketplace out of our private human experiences. That is the conclusion of an explosive new book that argues big tech platforms like Facebook and Google are elephant poachers, and our personal data is ivory tusks. Author Shoshana Zuboff writes in “The Age of Surveillance Capital e Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Pow t its core, surveillance capitalism is parasitic and self-referential. It revives Karl Marx’s old image of capitalism as a vampire that feeds on labor, but with an unexpected turn. Instead of labor, surveillance capitalism feeds on every aspect of every human’s experience.”

- Human experience is a material, used in creation of predictions of our behavious, sold to other companies.
- This method has evolved from Google -> Facebook -> Other Tech -> Every other company, not it is everywhere.
- Surveillance Capitalism is used to slowly nudge, tune our behavior. Can't exit as it traps us slowly, helps us till we cannot live without it. Starts to control our decision rights
- Privacy protection licences are actually surveillance licence

Main Takeaway:

Surveillance capitalism is a growing concern, according to a discussion featuring Harvard Business School professor emeritus Shoshana Zuboff. In her new book, "The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power", Zuboff presents a detailed critique of the practices of large tech companies like Facebook and Google, particularly their extraction and monetization of personal data, and the implications these have for exploitation and undermining democracy. 

- Understanding Surveillance Capitalism:
  - Surveillance capitalism represents the commodification of personal data, as explained by Zuboff. Tech companies extract, analyze, and sell this data to earn profits.
  - The system is an evolved form of market capitalism, which Zuboff describes as parasitic and self-referential, feeding off every human experience.
  - Zuboff traces the origins of surveillance capitalism back to Google's strategy of online targeted advertising during the dotcom bust financial emergency.

- Implications of Surveillance Capitalism: 
  - The discussion highlights surveillance capitalism's creation of a "global architecture of behavior modification". 
  - Tech companies subtly manipulate users' behaviors to optimize profit, utilizing sophisticated algorithms and cues, often without users' knowledge or consent, as highlighted by Zuboff.
  - Zuboff asserts that this intentional behavior modification is a direct assault on human autonomy, individual sovereignty, and democratic principles.

- Facebook and Google's Role in Surveillance Capitalism:
  - Zuboff likens Facebook and Google to elephant poachers, with personal data being the "ivory tusks". 
  - Users have been misled into believing they are the product, while they are actually the source of free raw material (data) for these companies, according to Zuboff.
  - Zuboff points out that these companies have normalized surveillance capitalism through strategies of misdirection and euphemism.

- Scandals and Regulatory Actions:
  - The discussion touches on recent scandals and regulatory actions against Facebook, such as the Cambridge Analytica scandal and a recent British report defining Facebook as "digital gangsters".
  - Zuboff argues these scandals are predictable outcomes of the surveillance capitalism model, rather than isolated incidents.
  - She also refers to a recent Wall Street Journal report that unveiled Facebook receiving sensitive personal data from popular smartphone applications.

- Calling for Regulation:
  - Zuboff emphasizes the necessity of robust regulation to safeguard user data and privacy. 
  - She warns that just focusing on individual companies like Facebook is insufficient; the entire economic model of surveillance capitalism needs to be addressed.
  - A societal response is necessary to interrupt and outlaw surveillance capitalism, as per Zuboff, arguing that this is vital to preserving democracy and human rights in the digital era.

- Research Surprises:
   - Zuboff expresses her astonishment at the level of institutionalized asymmetries of knowledge she exposed during her research on surveillance capitalism. She argues that this represents a new form of social inequality in the 21st century.
   - The fact that tech companies know everything about us, but we know almost nothing about them, was a surprising find for Zuboff. She suggests that this knowledge imbalance poses a major threat to individual freedom and democracy.

- Core Content:
  - Zuboff presents the idea that companies like Google have introduced a new form of capitalism, termed "surveillance capitalism."
  - Users of digital services are not the product but are the source from which these companies extract their 'raw material' - personal data.
  - This data is transformed into 'behavioral surplus' which is then used to create 'prediction products' sold in a new market called the 'behavioral futures market.'

- Extraction Imperative:
  - Surveillance capitalists are constantly seeking more predictive sources of behavioral surplus.
  - The goal is to extract as much data as possible to maximize profits.
  - Every aspect of society and human interaction becomes a potential source of data extraction.

- Google's Role:
  - Google is seen as the pioneer of surveillance capitalism.
  - Their diverse range of products, from Gmail to Google Maps, all serve the purpose of extracting behavioral data.
  - Zuboff argues that while surveillance capitalism began digitally, it's no longer limited to digital-born companies.

- Economies of Scale, Scope, and Action:
  - Surveillance capitalists compete to find new sources of raw material.
  - Economies of scale focus on the amount of data, computing power, and machine learning sophistication.
  - Economies of scope emphasize the depth and variety of data, extending beyond online activities to offline life.
  - Economies of action involve manipulating behavior to achieve specific outcomes, with Pokémon Go cited as an example.

- Internet of Things and Instrumentarianism:
  - The 'Internet of Things' is seen as a means of behavioral modification.
  - Zuboff introduces the term 'instrumentarianism' to describe the aim of surveillance capitalism, which is not societal perfection but the automation of society for guaranteed market outcomes.

- Critiques and Assumptions:
  - The article critiques Zuboff's assumption that surveillance capitalism produces accurate knowledge and can genuinely predict behavior.
  - There's a challenge to the distinction Zuboff makes between economy and politics, arguing that surveillance capitalism is inherently political.

- Surveillance Capitalism's Impact on Democracy:
  - Zuboff's analysis paints a picture of an antidemocratic world shaped by companies like Google and Facebook.
  - The behavioral modification tools of surveillance capitalism pose threats to democracy, human dignity, and create new forms of social inequality.
  - The book concludes with a note of hope, suggesting that democracy might eventually prevail against the forces of surveillance capitalism.

- Quotes in the article:
  - "The extraction imperative is driven by the desire for huge profits: the more and the better a company extracts behavioral surplus, the more profits it can make."
  - "The surveillance market is a hugely profitable market."
  - "In Pokémon Go, all this data was used not only to predict your behavior, but to direct you to very specific locations: pizzerias, tea houses, parks and coffee bars"
  - "Machine processes are configured to *"nudge, tune, herd, manipulate, and modify behavior in specific directions"*"
