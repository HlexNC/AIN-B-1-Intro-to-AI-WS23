The "The Age of Surveillance Capitalism" examines many intriguing and critical discussions surrounding modern-day surveillance capitalism. However, "The Discovery of Behavioral Surplus" within Part I: The Foundations of Surveillance Capitalism, caught my eye. The section explores how tech companies, like Google, pioneered the extraction and exploitation of behavioral data, and how this behavioral surplus became a cornerstone for the economic model of surveillance capitalism. The section is important for understanding how personal data is generalized and used in the digital economy, affecting privacy, autonomy, and democracy.
